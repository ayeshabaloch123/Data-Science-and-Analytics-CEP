## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing World Bank Poverty Data to derive insights and predictions related to sustainable development goals. Leveraging data science and analytics techniques, the project aims to contribute to addressing poverty-related challenges. The analysis involves the application of the CRISP-DM process, including data preparation, analysis, modeling, and visualization stages. Random Forest and SVM classifiers are employed for predictive modeling. Our choosen SDG was "No Poverty".

## Key Features
- Analyzes World Bank Poverty Data to address sustainable development challenges.
- Applies the CRISP-DM process for comprehensive data analysis.
- Utilizes Random Forest and SVM classifiers for predictive modeling.
- Includes data preparation, analysis, modeling, and visualization steps.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Bank Poverty Data. The dataset provides information on various economic and poverty-related indicators for different regions and countries.

## Libraries Used

The analysis utilizes the following Python libraries:

- pandas (version  2.1.1): For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib (version  3.8.0): For data visualization.
- scikit-learn (version 0.24.2): For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Visualization:** Visualizations using matplotlib to represent trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Building machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict and classify poverty indicators.

4. **README:** Detailed information about the project, dataset source, and libraries used.



## Instructions for Running the Code

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

3. Ensure that the dataset file is placed in the correct directory.
